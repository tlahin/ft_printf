# ft_printf

  Becase I'm tired of using putnbr and putstr...

  The key to a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and good extensible code. This
  is because as time goes by, you will be more and more tempted to continue to extend
  your ft_printf, making your life easier for your future projects. So take your time to
  code properly while keeping in mind that you will have to read again your code in a few
  weeks or a few months to extend its functionality according to your needs. It would be a
  shame not to being able to do it because your canâ€™t read your own work...
